     * to upper.
     *
     * If it is exactly on the line, then we return false.
     *
     * Note that we use the following inverted equation for lines to make the determination.
     * The equation can easily be confirmed, but care must be taken based upon the sign
     * of the slope (since we are dividing by m).
     *
     *                 (y2 - y1)
     *    0 = y - y1 - --------- (x - x1)
     *                 (x2 - x1)
     *
     * Since this operation is SO COMMON, we use a standard trick to remove the IF statements.
     * Specifically, if m is positive, then we check if res &lt; 0 but if m is negative, then we
     * check if -res &lt; 0. Thus we also need to store the SIGN of the slope with each segment.
